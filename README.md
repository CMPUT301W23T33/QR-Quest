## Resources

Some of the resources you need to go through in the future when querying the Firestore database to implement the features from the issues:
- [Firestore Data Model](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#java_4)
- [Firestore Data Types](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/data-types)
- [Firestore Index Overview](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/index-overview)
- [Firestore Structure Data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/structure-data)
- [Firestore Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/android/start)

## Notes

You might want to go through the base code in branch vanh under project "Base" (sorry the skeleton code is informal so I can't really push it to develop) for the camera and the layouts in the branch develop under project "code"  for some of the components that Thea created.

Next week is the midterm week so we would report the progress of our task on Wednesday and resolve any issues to accommodate our schedules and get the work done by Thursday.
